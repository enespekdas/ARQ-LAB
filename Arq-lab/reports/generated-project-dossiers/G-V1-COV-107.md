## 2. Business Context and Why This Repo Is Realistic

This scenario models `Marketing and growth credential corpus covering analytics, ads, email, and campaign providers.` as a `Config / IaC / CI credential coverage bundle` repository. The repo is shaped to look like something an enterprise team would actually maintain so that ARQ validation is exercised against realistic layout, runtime config, supporting docs, and test collateral rather than an isolated toy snippet.

A real customer could plausibly own this repository because it bundles the operational surfaces that usually travel with the business function: runtime code, deploy/config material, tests, scripts, and enough written collateral to resemble an actively maintained internal service or support repository. The scenario goal is `Guardian provider coverage bundle exercising 20 distinct secret families.`.

## 4. Full Repository Tree

Tree below covers authored project files and retained build outputs. VCS internals and dependency caches such as `.git`, `node_modules`, `target`, `obj`, `bin`, and `__pycache__` are intentionally excluded because they are tool-restored rather than scenario-authored content.

### must_not_find

- None.

### may_find_review

- None in the current run.

## 14. Explainability Expectations

Guardian-only scenario. Quantum explainability contract is not applicable here.

## 15. FP/FN Risk Notes

- False positives are most likely on docs, tests, fixtures, and generated output that contain scary-looking examples.
- Strict failures: any `must_find` miss, any `must_not_find` hit, any explainability miss on a matched expected path, and any ref-state mismatch.
- Review-needed results: INFO/inventory-only spillover on protected negatives and regex-only spillover without scenario contract coverage.
- Current run already demonstrated this risk: verdict=`FAIL_FN`.

## 16. Realism Justification

- Why this repo is not a toy snippet: it includes runtime surfaces, build/test/smoke commands, and enough adjacent docs/config/tests to model customer-shaped maintenance reality.
- What makes it feel real: build/test/smoke contracts execute successfully; synthetic filler is materially visible and pulls realism down.
- What is still synthetic: line-target inflation docs/runbooks/SQL references and curated positive/negative placements are intentionally authored for validation, not copied from a customer.
- Realism score: `1/5`

## 17. Final Reviewer Summary

- What this scenario is proving: `Guardian provider coverage bundle exercising 20 distinct secret families.`
- What it is not proving: comprehensive customer architecture fidelity beyond the declared validation contract.
- First outputs to inspect on failure: `C:\Users\EnesPekdas\Desktop\ARQV2\LAB\Arq-lab\repositories\guardian-coverage-marketing\validation\generated-project-dossier.md`, `C:\Users\EnesPekdas\Desktop\ARQV2\LAB\Arq-lab\repositories\guardian-coverage-marketing\validation\generated-file-manifest.json`, comparison artifacts under the latest `runs/` directory, and the persisted runnability logs referenced above.
