## 2. Business Context and Why This Repo Is Realistic

This scenario models `Documentation repo with public cert chains, JWKS, CSRs, and sample PEM blocks but no live private key or misuse.` as a `Docs / PKI / JWKS` repository. The repo is shaped to look like something an enterprise team would actually maintain so that ARQ validation is exercised against realistic layout, runtime config, supporting docs, and test collateral rather than an isolated toy snippet.

A real customer could plausibly own this repository because it bundles the operational surfaces that usually travel with the business function: runtime code, deploy/config material, tests, scripts, and enough written collateral to resemble an actively maintained internal service or support repository. The scenario goal is `Public-key and PKI docs surfaces should remain clean.`.

## 3. Architecture Summary

- Major components: `app, docs, ops, scripts, sql, tests, validation`
- Runtime role: `Documentation repo with public cert chains, JWKS, CSRs, and sample PEM blocks but no live private key or misuse.`
- Config flow: `No dedicated live-config files; runtime behavior is code-driven.`
- Secret flow: `No Guardian must-find secret path in this scenario.`
- Crypto/TLS flow if relevant: `Not a Quantum-positive scenario.`
- Test surfaces: `tests/test_audit_service.py, tests/test_delivery_service.py, tests/test_dispatch_service.py, tests/test_metrics_service.py, tests/test_preferences_service.py, tests/test_retry_service.py, tests/test_routing_service.py, tests/test_templates_service.py`
- Docs/vendor/generated surfaces: `README.md, docs/architecture/section-01.md, docs/architecture/section-02.md, docs/architecture/section-03.md, docs/architecture/section-04.md, docs/architecture/section-05.md, docs/architecture/section-06.md, docs/architecture/section-07.md, docs/architecture/section-08.md, docs/architecture/section-09.md, docs/architecture/section-10.md, docs/architecture/section-11.md`

## 4. Full Repository Tree

Tree below covers authored project files and retained build outputs. VCS internals and dependency caches such as `.git`, `node_modules`, `target`, `obj`, `bin`, and `__pycache__` are intentionally excluded because they are tool-restored rather than scenario-authored content.

## 12. Line Composition and Filler Disclosure

- Total LOC considered for authored/generated project content: `5029`
- Synthetic filler / inflation LOC: `4730`
- Synthetic filler ratio: `94.05%`

| category | LOC |
| --- | ---: |
| live business code | 85 |
| live config | 0 |
| tests | 32 |
| docs | 40 |
| scripts | 1 |
| fixtures | 0 |
| vendor/generated | 126 |
| synthetic filler / inflation content | 4730 |

Inflation disclosure:

- Line targets are met partly with generated architecture docs, ops runbooks, and SQL reference files under `docs/architecture/`, `ops/playbooks/`, and `sql/reference/`.
- These filler lines are intentionally disclosed above and are not being presented as live business logic.

## 13. Expected Findings Matrix

### must_find

- None.

### must_not_find

- path: `docs/jwks`
  why finding must not appear: scenario declares this path clean despite adversarial content or naming.
  negative type: `protected negative`
- path: `docs/csr`
  why finding must not appear: scenario declares this path clean despite adversarial content or naming.
  negative type: `protected negative`
- path: `docs/pem`
  why finding must not appear: scenario declares this path clean despite adversarial content or naming.
  negative type: `protected negative`

### may_find_review

- None in the current run.

## 14. Explainability Expectations

- `detectionSource`: scenario checks it only when explicitly declared; regex-only live exports are tolerated unless the scenario contract says otherwise.
- `semanticKey`: informative but not currently a strict blocker unless a scenario-specific follow-up adds it.
- `resolvedValue`: strict on files that have an explainability contract entry.
- `resolutionScope`: strict only when declared by the scenario explainability contract.
- `queryFamily`: strict only when declared by the scenario explainability contract.
- `rawEvidenceJson`: not a mandatory contract field in the current scenario pack unless added explicitly later.

Scenario-specific explainability expectations:

- No strict scenario-specific explainability expectations were declared.

Explainability failure definition:

- A finding exists on the expected path, but the declared explainability fields are missing or do not match the scenario contract.

## 15. FP/FN Risk Notes

- False positives are most likely on docs, tests, fixtures, and generated output that contain scary-looking examples.
- Strict failures: any `must_find` miss, any `must_not_find` hit, any explainability miss on a matched expected path, and any ref-state mismatch.
- Review-needed results: INFO/inventory-only spillover on protected negatives and regex-only spillover without scenario contract coverage.

## 16. Realism Justification

- Why this repo is not a toy snippet: it includes runtime surfaces, build/test/smoke commands, and enough adjacent docs/config/tests to model customer-shaped maintenance reality.
- What makes it feel real: build/test/smoke contracts execute successfully; synthetic filler is materially visible and pulls realism down.
- What is still synthetic: line-target inflation docs/runbooks/SQL references and curated positive/negative placements are intentionally authored for validation, not copied from a customer.
- Realism score: `1/5`

## 17. Final Reviewer Summary

- What this scenario is proving: `Public-key and PKI docs surfaces should remain clean.`
- What it is not proving: comprehensive customer architecture fidelity beyond the declared validation contract.
- First outputs to inspect on failure: `C:\Users\EnesPekdas\Desktop\ARQV2\LAB\Arq-lab\repositories\public-key-docs-repo\validation\generated-project-dossier.md`, `C:\Users\EnesPekdas\Desktop\ARQV2\LAB\Arq-lab\repositories\public-key-docs-repo\validation\generated-file-manifest.json`, comparison artifacts under the latest `runs/` directory, and the persisted runnability logs referenced above.
